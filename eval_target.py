    Method is to be completed. It's supposed to do evaluation of the target domain:
    if I can predict the orientation of the target image => image is from known category
    results are returned in a file under the "new_txt_list" folder

    Parameters
    ---------
        args : data-type -> {source : str, target : str}
            source and target fields contain the name of a class of images (such as "Clipart" or "RealWorld") (? maybe)
        feature_extractor
            only used for calling it's eval() method
        rot_cls
            stands for rotation classifier. Only used for calling it's eval() method
        target_loader_eval : list<data-type> -> {data, class_l, data_rot, rot_l}
            Is an iterable wrapping the dataset containing images of target domain and their labels. for each image contains: image, label for the image, rotated image, label for the rotated image
        device
            CPU or GPU ?
    Returns
    -------
        rand : number
            identifier of the file in which results of the evaluation will be stored
